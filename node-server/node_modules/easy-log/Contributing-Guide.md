# How to Contribute, Create Issues, and Submit Pull Requests

## Creating Issues: 

The first thing you should always do, no matter the objective, is create an issue. Use appropriate labels to indicate the purpose of the issue.
For example, use the `bug` label to indicate you have found an error in the module, or the `feature request` label to indicate something you want to be added.

### Rules for creating issues: 

* Use a clear, descriptive title
* Tell us what you want and *why*
* If you can, please include suggestions on how to accomplish the objective
* Do not be rude to our collaborators. Everyone that works on this does so on their own free time and owe you nothing
* Use the appropriate template
* The better you follow these rules, the more likely we are to work on your issue
